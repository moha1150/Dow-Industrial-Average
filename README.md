The app includes an HTML div element for the chart and a JavaScript script that uses Chart.js to create a line chart comparing the DOW in January 2021 to December 2021.
The data for the chart is provided in the januaryData and decemberData arrays, which contain objects representing the date and closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for each day.
The chart is configured with options to display the values on the y-axis as dollar amounts.
